### **Currently Studying and Self Learning**

Hi! I am Hasnain. A **Coding Enthusiast**.

I’ve always been curious and eager to learn new things, which naturally drew me to programming. I enjoy working with code and exploring different areas of development, but my true passion lies in Software Engineering. I find a lot of joy in troubleshooting and solving bugs—it’s like solving a fun puzzle!
